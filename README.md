**Popular Movies** is one of the projects I made from scratch for Udacity's [*Associate Android Developer Fast Track*](https://www.udacity.com/course/associate-android-developer-fast-track--nd818) course supported by Google.
The app uses core Android UI components and fetches movie details using themoviedb.org free API.

# How to run

You need to enter your own API key for The Movie Database API in order to fetch the movies.
Do steps as described below to run the app.

  1. Copy the project
  2. Get your own *API key* from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api .
  3. In [`app/src/main/res/values`](app/src/main/res/values) create new resource file with name `movie_db_api.xml`.
  4. Use [`movie_db_api.xml.example`](app/src/main/res/values/movie_db_api.xml.example#L3) to paste contents of the newly created file
  5. Uncomment line with key
  6. Enter your key instead of `PutYourKeyHere`
  7. Run the app! üëç
